 PAI


The system is designed to read a CSV file sent in on a monthly basis. The file is intended to be loaded in a pre-existing database with multiple tables. Python being the key programming language for this solution, the file is expected to be broken down and loaded in multiple tables under one schema IBRD_UG. 

After the file loading process is done and the file is complete, a number of results set in Excel workbooks are created in the directory “OUTPUT” in the home path of the source code.
